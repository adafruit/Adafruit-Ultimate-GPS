### Description

These boards are built around the MTK3339 chipset, a no-nonsense, high-quality GPS module that can track up to 22 satellites on 66 channels, has an excellent high-sensitivity receiver (-165 dBm tracking!), and a built-in antenna. It can do up to 10 location updates a second for high speed, high sensitivity logging, or tracking. Power usage is incredibly low, only 20 mA during navigation.

We believe this is the Ultimate GPS module, so we named it that. It's got everything you want and more:

* -165 dBm sensitivity, 10 Hz updates, 66 channels
* 5V friendly design and only 20mA current draw
* RTC battery-compatible
* Built-in datalogging
* PPS output on fix
* Internal patch antenna + u.FL connector for external active antenna
* Fix status LED
* Pulse-Per-Second output
